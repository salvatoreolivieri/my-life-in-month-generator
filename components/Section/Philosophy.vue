        and totally in love with the memento mori stoic principle, I decide to
        create the "Life Calendar Generator‚Äù to
        <strong>
          help people value the importance of their time becoming aware of their
          mortality</strong
        >. In order to live, we must be fully aware of our limitations, the most
        significant of which is the
        <strong>scarcity and uncertain length of time</strong> we are granted.
        Not recognizing this limitation, and living accordingly is one of
        <strong>humanity's most tragic trends</strong>
        because it often leads people to
        <strong>sacrificeand devalue the present</strong> in the false hope that
        there will always be a future in which to make amends.
        <strong>Death can be compared to the sun</strong>. Both are integral
        components of life, but staring at them for too long only leads to
        debilitation - damaged eyes in the case of the sun and crippling anxiety
        in the case of death. Walking completely away from death, however, can
        be just as debilitating.
        <strong
          >Just as the sun's rays are necessary to sustain life, periodic
          reflection on death seems necessary to imbue life with a spark of
          urgency and an appreciation for the present</strong
